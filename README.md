Repository Name: Advanced Visualization for Movie Ratings Analysis

Overview

 This repository includes a comprehensive analysis of movie ratings from both critics and audiences. The dataset, Movie-Rating.csv, contains information on various films including their genre, ratings from Rotten Tomatoes and audience reviews, budget, and release year.

Features
 * Data Cleaning and Preparation: Includes steps to clean and transform data for analysis, such as converting data types and renaming columns.
 * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.
 * Advanced Visualization: Utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib to create detailed visualizations:
  * Joint plots to explore the relationship between critic and audience ratings.
  * Distribution plots to analyze rating distributions.
  * Histograms and KDE plots to understand budget distributions across genres.
  * Facet grids for multi-dimensional analysis, exploring how ratings and budgets vary across genres and years.
  * Box plots and violin plots to visualize rating distributions by genre and year.
    
Tools and Libraries
 * Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
 * Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
 * Jupyter Notebook: For running the analysis and visualizations interactively.

Key Highlights:
  * Data Analysis: Initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
  * Advanced Visualization: Creation of detailed and insightful plots using Python libraries.
  * Tools & Libraries: Utilizes Python with Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib (plt) and Seaborn (sns) for advanced visualizations.
    
Files Included:
  * movie_ratings_analysis.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the full analysis and visualizations.
  * movie_ratings.csv: The dataset used for this analysis.
